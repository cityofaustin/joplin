    <h2>Prepare for an emergency</h2>
    Preparing for public health emergencies is critical to protect everyoneâ€™s health and wellbeing. Public health emergencies include natural disasters, disease outbreaks like pandemic flu, as well as those related to homeland security, such as a biological or chemical terrorist attack.

    We work closely with other local, state, and federal emergency management authorities to plan and prepare for any emergency that affects the health of the public. For emergency conditions and information on disaster preparedness, visit the <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/hsem">City of Austin Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management</a>.

    <h2>Have a plan to stay safe in an emergency</h2>
    When disaster hits, Austinites need to be ready. Use the online resources from the <a href="https://www.texasprepares.org/default.htm">Texas Department of State Health Services</a> to build your plan -- including family strategies, handy checklists, and special needs considerations for people with disabilities, the elderly, and pets.
