            <h2>Understanding fostering</h2>
            <p>Fostering provides a temporary home for a homeless pet who, for whatever reason, needs to live outside of the shelter. Puppies, kittens, animals recovering from illness or injury, and animals with special behavioral challenges most often need fostering.</p>
            <p>As a foster, you should be compassionate, caring, and patient. You will be provided with resources and information to be a successful foster parent, including your foster animal’s known history and medical and behavioral health before they are placed in your care.</p>
            <p>Fostering can be flexible. Foster commitments range from just a couple of days to several months, so you can choose foster options that fit within your lifestyle. </p>
            <hr />
            <h2>Find out if you’re eligible to foster</h2>
            <p>You must meet the following requirements to foster:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be willing to abide by the foster care agreement and other policies and procedures provided to you.</li>
                <li>Be able to access email regularly.</li>
                <li>Be able to provide transport to and from the animal center.</li>
                <li>Provide some supplies and food for foster animals.</li>
                <li>Spend time with foster pets and treat them like your own animals while they’re in your care.</li>
                <li>Have up-to-date rabies vaccinations for all animals in the home.</li>
            </ul>
