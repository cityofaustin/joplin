# This function is deprecated
# The default behavior of Joplin is to point to the remote staging CMS_MEDIA location,
# which means you no longer need to download media files manually.
# Previously, that was something we needed to do with this script.
# It parsed a backup file from the db/smuggler directory and placed all referenced images into the local media folder.
# It is no longer required as part of the development process.
