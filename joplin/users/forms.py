        Why do we have this weird is_superuser fallback?
        Because if a user is editing their own information, they cannot toggle their own superuser status.
        "is_superuser" is determined by the "Administrator" checkbox on the edit user page.
        However, the "Administrator" Checkbox won't show up for you when you're editing your own user.
        A user can neither make themselves an admin nor make themselves not an admin.
        cleaned_data only passes data submitted from the frontend form.
        So cleaned_data will not contain "is_superuser" if you're editing your own user.

        So then how can we tell if you are a superuser or not?
        There is a property called "self.initial" that contains the previous state of user data.
        So if cleaned_data doesn't have "is_superuser", then we can assume that it's because a user is editing themselves.
        And their is_superuser status will be in their prior data.
        Note: we only want to check self.initial if cleaned_data.get("is_superuser") is None and does not exist, not if its False.
