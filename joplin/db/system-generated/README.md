Important Reminder: There must only be ONE "[latest-migration-name].datadump.json" file in this directory. Our scripts that load data test for `joplin/db/system-generated/*.datadump.json`, so if there are multiple data files ending with ".datadump.json" then they will collide with each other.

The `*.datadump.json` file is generated by `/scripts/migration-test.sh`.

Place your own custom datadumps into a different directory or place your smuggler datadumps into the `/smuggler` directory.

Thank you!
