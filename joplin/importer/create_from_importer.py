        HomePage.objects.first() must be retrieved here at the end of create_page_from_importer(), rather than the beginning.
        Why? Because our HomePage model might have changed during the course of create_page_from_importer() if other pages
        were added (like topics).
        If our 'parent' is an instance of an outdated HomePage, then there will be wagtail path conflicts for your page.
